## First, I would like to say that I couldn't change the x axis label (it automatically, when I loaded the respective function, it changed to the portuguese week day names).
## So, "qui" "sex" and "sab" stands for, respectively, "Thu", "Fri" and "Sat".
## I did some research about how to modify the labels for the correct english ones, but didn't have success.
## Please, if you know how to do this modification, let me know on your comments. Moreover, advices, suggestions and critics are always welcome.
## Thanks for your review.
